Table 1. Physical Elements Codes - PE DTSEP

NOTE:  Appendix A contains definitions for unit abbreviations and acronyms
used in Table 1.  Appendix G contains an in-depth explanation of PE codes. The
notation of "(S)" after the PE code designates that there is a send code for
that data type.  See Table 2 for send codes.  A "(V)" after the PE code means
that a vector component for the data type may be defined at a later date.
