require changes to 2 routines in the bridge library.

Currently, DCMXBF is 100KB. 


Modifications to support updated shef decoder, 12/2002:

   1) gempak/source/bridge/dc/dcgbul.c:

      Modified to return the data that was read when EBFULL
      occurs.  Consecutive calls that return EBFULL return
      the next piece of a message that overflowed the buffer
      along with an EBFULL status until the last piece is
      read which does not overflow the buffer, which then
      returns a normal status.  Calling programs can use
      this facility to retrieve all the data of a message
      when the internal read buffer overflows by accumulating
      data on EBFULL's until a non-EBFULL status is returned.
      The data returned when the non-EBFULL status is returned
      (after EBFULL status returns) is the last data of the
      overflowing message.  Following calls which return
      non-EBFULL status would contain subsequent messages.

   2) gempak/source/bridge/dc/dcb.c:

      Documentation on the use of the read buffer pointers
      was added.  Also, a bug was fixed in the case where
      dcb.nxtfeed+1 was not set equal to dcb.sbuf upon buffer
      wrap-around when checking for a buffer full error
      return.

   3) gempak/comet/dcshef/dcshcd.f:

      Increased read buffer size as a multiple of DCMXBF and
      implemented code to accumulate multiple buffers full of
      input data for a single message when EBFULL is returned
      from DC_GBUL base on code changes mentioned in #1 above.
