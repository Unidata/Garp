Bug Fixes</H2>

<UL>
<LI>
Some model levels and layers did not display in the level popup dialog.
Now they do.</LI>

<LI>
Some widget attachments were not properly alligned when using the CDE window manager.
Now, they are.</LI>

<LI>
Fixed a bug that caused GARP to crash if you loaded a topographic image
and then immediatly cleared the screen without loading any other
depictables.</LI>

<LI>
Fixed a bug that caused GARP to crash if you load a plan view depictable
and then immediately load (without clearing) a cross-section vector
depictable.</LI>

<LI>
Fixed a bug that caused the titles of all the model vertical projections
to be the wrong color when a title was toggled off.</LI>

<LI>
Redefined how default directories are built in dialogs.c to define a
default chapter for each projection. These previously existed but were
broken at some point. Did not add any keys  to Garp_defaults but this
change affects the keys: fdf_directory, xsfdf_directory, thfdf_directory,
and vpfdf_directory. Previously, the corresponding root directory was
explicitly part of the these directory definitions in Garp_defaults. Now,
they are implicit, meaning, they are used to define the root directory
even though they are not included in the default key definitions.</LI>

<LI>
A few memory leaks plugged.</LI>
