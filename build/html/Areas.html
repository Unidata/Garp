<h1><center>GARP Geographic Areas</center></h1>

<p>
The buttons available under the Area button of the main menubar define 
a preset list
of geographic areas from which you can choose. They are configurable in 
"Garp_defaults". Three specialized buttons of note are
<ul>
<li>DEFAULT which will reset the projection and area to the default projection
and area for the current data type. These default projections are 
configurable in "Garp_defaults" on a per data type basis
<li>Define which allows you to explicitly define a projection and area
<li>Previous which allows you to redisplay the previous projection and area
</ul>
Note that you can also define a geographic area with either of two
<a href="Interface9.html#Z">zoom</a> features using the left mouse 
button in the display window.
