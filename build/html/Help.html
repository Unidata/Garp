When you click the GARP Help button on the right side of the main
menubar, you see a dropdown menu with several
options. Some of the buttons such as About GARP, pop up a simple Motif
dialog with information printed in it. Other buttons such as User's
Guide launch a browser pointing to a URL (or file). The browser launched
by this button must reside on your system and is configurable in 
"Garp_defaults". Future versions of GARP may include a built-in browser.
