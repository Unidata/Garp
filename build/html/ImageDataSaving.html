Image Data Saving in GARP 2.x</H2></CENTER>

<HR>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>Image data is saved internally in GARP to provide instant pixel value
readout on the <A HREF="StatusBar.html">Status Bar</A>. Starting with version
2.0 of GARP, a major change was made to the way image data is saved internally.
In previous versions of GARP, the size of the saved data was equal to the
size of the GARP drawing window. In this version, the entire image is retained,
regardless of the drawing window size. The reason this was done was to
allow possible future image combination capability. But, this change also
has implications on how much memory is consumed saving the image data.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>A typical usage scenario will illustrate the change. Assuming a GARP
drawing window of 1100 by750 pixels , and a 640 x 480 image, the amount
of memory required to save an image in the old version used to be 825KB
(1100 * 750). In the new version, the amount of memory required is the
size of the image, so about 307KB (640 * 480). This is a substantial savings
in memory, especially for long loops. In addition, the data does not need
to be re-read from disk for zoom operations or geographic area changes
because the full image is already saved internally and can just be re-rendered.

<P>However, the tradeoff comes when image sizes become larger than the
GARP drawing window (about 825KB) . For example, an image of size 1400
by 1700 now requires almost 2.4MB to save internally.&nbsp; This causes
GARP to consume more memory than it used to. In situations where memory
is scarce, the internal saving of image data can be toggled off via the
<A HREF="StatusBar.html">Status Bar </A>dialog. If the user does this,
more memory is freed up to view images, but pixel value readout will not
be available.
