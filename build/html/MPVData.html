<p>
All gridded data dialogs have a similar layout. This layout is organized to
(hopefully) present information in an intuitively top-down order. The current
model is in the upper left hand corner. The list of models you have access
to is configurable in the "Garp_defaults" file but limited to the data itself. 
When you choose a new model,
GARP reads in the data files for that model and rebuilds a scrolled list of
date times. Depending on how much data you have this may take a while;
you will notice the mouse pointer changes to a busy cursor while files are
being read.
<p>
 Below the model option menu is an option menu of 
vertical coordinates which is also configurable in "Garp_defaults". To pick
a new one, you can either choose one from the option menu or type in the
GEMPAK identifier for this vertical coordinate.
<p>
For the
plan view projection dialog, you will see two level buttons and textfields
below the vertical coordinate button. When you click either of these
buttons, you will get a list of vertical levels valid for that model and 
vertical coordinate. Some fields are layered quantities and require both
level 1 (bottom) and level 2 (top) to have valid values. Layers which are
explicitly defined in a GEMPAK file are denoted as two levels separated by
a colon.
<p>
Toggle buttons indicating whether you want to display contour lines, color
fill, or high/low symbols are to the right of the level buttons. Further right
is an information button from which you can browse your data set to see exactly
what fields, vertical coordinates and levels are valid.
<p>
Across the center of the dialog are scrolled lists indicating date/time stamps
for which data is available, a scalar FDF list, and a vector FDF list. The 
option menus above the FDF scrolled lists are different chapters that contain
FDFs for particular meteorological conditions. They also point to macros
that allow you to display more than one field at a time.
<p>
Below these scrolled lists is a label for the current field as well as the
GEMPAK function definition. You can manually edit this function representation
or just click a new FDF to change it.
<p>
In the lower left corner you'll see radio buttons that indicate whether the
current field is a scalar or vector and whether it is a level field (only one
level required) or a layered field (two levels required).
<p>
Across the bottom of the dialog you'll see buttons that activate current 
settings in this dialog. The Refresh button allows you to reload the 
date/time stamp scrolled list. The More button pops up another dialog that
gives you access to more options.

<p>
This dialog allows you to adjust particular aspects of how the data
is presented. You can set contour line parameters, color fill parameters,
vector symbol type, whether to display highs and lows of a scalar field, and
a scale factor by which to multiply the field. A description of the current 
field is found near the bottom of the dialog.
