<p>
This dialog allows you to change the font size, symbol size, symbol thickness
and symbol plot density. You can access this dialog either by clicking
the right mouse button when you are in the display window or from
the "Option" dropdown menu. This dialog gives you the
ability to easily change display characteristics that are common across
many data types.
<p>
Buttons left of middle will decrease the parameter you are adjusting and
buttons to the right will increase it. If you click Apply and some
data is loaded, it will automatically reload the data applying the change
you made. Otherwise, the change will be applied the next time you load
data.
<p>
The font size is generic to virtually all data you will display. Obviously,
"symbol" parameters will only be applied to data that has some kind of 
symbol. For surface observations these would include symbols such as sky 
cover symbols, wind barbs, and  weather symbols. For 
<a href="Overlay.html">station overlays</a>
the Symbol Size parameter affects the station position marker.
Surface observation plot density can be adjusted with the Symbol Packing 
setting. However, station overlays are not affected by symbol 
packing (by design).
