Part of the GARP configuration requires that you define the environment 
variable GARP_PATH. This variable is a colon separated list of directories
to search for the file "Garp_defaults". Having a 
list of directories rather than a single directory provides more versatility
in configuration. For example, you could configure the first directory in
the list to point to a user's private directory and the second directory to a
system default. Then, the user can place a copy of Garp_defaults in his 
.app-defaults/ directory containing his personal preferences. For example:
<pre>
setenv GARP_PATH ${HOME}/.app-defaults/:/usr1/nawips/comet/garp/config/
</pre>
<p>
You also need to put the files "Garp" and "Garp2" into a directory pointed to
by the environment variable XUSERFILESEARCHPATH. This environment variable
defines locations of X application resource files and should already be 
defined as part of your system configuration. An example for the value of this
variable is:
<pre>
XUSERFILESEARCHPATH=/home/comet/steve/.app-defaults/%N:/usr1/nawips/resource/%N:/usr/local/lib/app-defaults/%N
</pre>
<p>
Other than GARP_PATH, the only environment variables required by GARP
are those required by the core N-AWIPS distribution. However, it may be 
convenient
to also define an environment variable GARPHOME to use as a reference
to the GARP distribution. This environment variable is required if you
are building GARP using the makefiles provided with the distribution.
For example, GARPHOME might look like:
<pre>
GARPHOME=/usr1/nawips/comet/garp
</pre>
