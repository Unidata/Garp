Surface data can be plotted for hourly METARs, locally configured mesonet
sites, for ship and buoy data, and for any other data stored in GEMPAK surface
file format. The user can choose between these options using the Scale
option menu under the surface data icon. This done, the scrolled list of 
dates and times is updated to reflect available data. Clicking the 
Multi-color toggle displays the data in different colors. Clicking the
Surface Layout button presents the user with the station parameters which
will be displayed for that data type.

The station layout matrix shows which parameters will be displayed in a given
position. These parameters are typically four-letter GEMPAK codes. The codes
valid for a given data type are visible in the scrolled list located below the 
station parameter layout. To change the layout, you can either type in the 
new parameter or drag it from the scrolled list to the textfield of your choice.
To the right of the station layout matrix, the Reset button allows you to 
reset the layout to the default value for that observation type 
(defined in "Garp_defaults"). Below
that, a marker toggle and symbol type allow you to plot a marker in the 
center of the data point position. This is useful for some obervation data
which would otherwise have no representation for the location of the sensor.
