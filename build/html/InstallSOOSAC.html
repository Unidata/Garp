* Special notes for those installing GARP version 2.1 on top of 
a previous version of GARP:
<p>
<ol>
<li>You must complete all the installation steps below, even if you've
already installed a previous version of GARP. 
<p>

<li>Before you untar GARP version 2.1, you must move your old
GARP distribution out of the way.  Use the command:</i>
<pre><b> mv $NAWIPS/garp $NAWIPS/garp.old</b></pre>

<p>
<i>

<li>GARP 2.1 configuration files are very similar to those in version
2.0. It is likely that minimal modifications of Garp_defaults will be required.
The keys that must be changed include:
<PRE>
scalarfdf     : $(fdfdir)/scalar             # Plan view scalar FDFs
vectorfdf     : $(fdfdir)/vector             # Plan view vector FDFs
xsscalarfdf   : $(fdfdir)/xsscalar           # Cross section scalar FDFs
xsvectorfdf   : $(fdfdir)/xsvector           # Cross section vector FDFs
thscalarfdf   : $(fdfdir)/xtscalar           # Time/height scalar FDFs
thvectorfdf   : $(fdfdir)/xtvector           # Time/height vector FDFs
vpscalarfdf   : $(fdfdir)/vpscalar           # Vertical profile scalar FDFs
vpvectorfdf   : $(fdfdir)/vpvector           # Vertical profile vector FDFs
</PRE>
Previously, these directories included a "default" directory. The 
configuration file "config/Garp" has minimal changes.
<p>

<li>After untarring and configuring GARP 2.1, you may want to
copy over any FDFs you created for previous versions of GARP.
The FDF directory structure has not changed from GARP 2.0.
<p>

<ol>
<li>FTP the file garp2.1.tar.Z and garp.install.README (this file) from 
the contrib/ directory of the SAC FTP server.
<p>



<li>Untar the distribution in the $NAWIPS directory.
<pre>
   % cd $NAWIPS
   % zcat garp2.1.tar.Z | tar xvf -
</pre>

Please examine the output of this command carefully.  (It's best
to run this command in a window with a scroll bar.)  If you see
any errors, particularly "permission denied" or "could not write"
errors, you must find and delete the existing file and then
untar the garp2.1.tar.Z file again.
<p>


<li>After untarring, you will find the following subdirectories
that contain configuration files and other files needed by GARP:

<pre>
README/   config/   fdf/   help/   icons/   map/   tables/
</pre>

Plus, the resource files (Garp and Garp2) will be added to 
the $NAWIPS/resource directory, a GARP icon will be added to the 
$NAWIPS/icons directory, and the GARP executable (garp) will be 
added to the $NAWIPS/exe/hpux directory.
<p>

<b>In addition</b>, the tar file will <b>overwrite</b> your existing 
$NAWIPS/tables/ntl/ntl.tbl file.  This file defines which icons are 
placed in the NTL box.  The GARP version of ntl.tbl simply adds a 
GARP icon to NTL.  Normally this file is not edited by the user, so 
the overwriting ntl.tbl with the GARP version has no impact.  However, 
if you have edited your $NAWIPS/tables/ntl/ntl.tbl file, you must 
protect it before you untar this distribution.
<p>


<li>To configure GARP for your system, you must add the following 
definition to your Nawips.cshrc file (adjust $GARP_PATH to match your 
system setup).  It doesn't matter where you add these lines, however 
after the "NAWIPS env variables" section (line 66) would make the most 
organizational sense.  

<pre>
#
#  GARP specific variables
#
    setenv GARP_PATH  $NAWIPS/garp/config
</pre>
<p>




<li>After adding these lines, be sure to source Nawips.cshrc:

<pre>
   % source Nawips.cshrc
   % rehash
</pre>

The next time you log on, the "source" and "rehash" will be done 
for you.
<p>


<li>Now you must edit the configuration file:

<pre>
$GARP_PATH/config/Garp_defaults
</pre>

This file defines the GEMPAK data directory structure used by GARP,
along with the default behavior of much of the GARP interface. 
There are a number of new variables which must be configured in
this file.  Please read the comments in the "Garp_defaults
file for help with configuring these settings.
<p>
<b>NOTE</b> When editing the Garp_defaults file, it is very important
that you <i>disable</i> word-wrapping in your editor.  This is not
a problem for those of you using <code><b>vi</b></code>, however if
you use <code><b>pico</b></code> or the HPUX CDE text editor, make
sure you do not <i>wrap to fit</i> the file.  There are many long
lines in the Garp_defaults file that must remain as single lines.
If they are wrapped to the next line, it is possible that GARP will
not run.<p>



<li>Install the GARP man page. Copy the file $NAWIPS/garp/README/garp.1 
to the /usr/man/man1 or /usr/local/man/man1 directory.  You may
need to be root to do this.  This step is not required to run GARP.
<p>

<li>A few background topography maps were added to GARP version 1.0.4 
(N. California, Virginia, Colorado, Minnesota).  These maps use a 
gray scale enhancement table by default.  If you have not modified
your $GEMTBL/sat/imgtyp.tbl file, you will see a GARP warning message 
that no enhancement table is defined when using these maps. 
If this message bothers you, add the following line to the end of your  
$GEMTBL/sat/imgtyp.tbl file:
<pre>
TOPO                 MAP           0    255     99      1      1 GRAY
</pre>
<p>

<li>New features have been added to the FDF system in GARP 2.0, including
Macros and a new directory structure.  You can read all about the new FDF 
and Macro features in the User's Guide (<a href="FDF.html">FDFs</a>, 
<a href="Macros.html">Macros</a>, and Question 2 in the Tips on FDFs & Macros
section of the <a href="TroubleShoot.html">Troubleshooting Guide</a>).   In 
addition, here is a brief summary of the FDF changes in GARP 2.0:<p>
<ul>
<li> The FDF directory tree contains an additional directory level.  The
directory <code><b>fdf/scalar/default</b></code> contains all the FDF
chapters for GARP 2.0.  <p>

<li> Along with the <code><b>default/</b></code> directory, there are also
model-specific directories that contain the same or additional FDF chapters.
These chapters contain additional (or modified) the FDFs for the specified
model. The model-specific directory is named by the string which identifies 
the model in the <b><code>modelkeys</code></b> variable in the Garp_defaults 
file.  For example, the Eta model is defined by the string <code><b>eta.gem</b></code>,
so the model-specific directory is named <code><b>fdf/scalar/eta.gem</b></code>.<p>

<li> The data available with each model differ.  Some models, such as the
RUC Surface Analysis (RSAS) have very few grids, and other models such as
the Meso-Eta have a lot of grids on a lot of surfaces.  This new FDF 
directory structure allows you to configure GARP so that only applicable
FDFs show up for each model.  For example, I have set up the <b>General</b> 
FDF chapter this way.  As you use GARP 2.1 with the various models, you'll
see that the FDFs listed under <b>General</b> change depending on the
model.  Compare this with the FDFs contained
in the <code><b>fdf/scalar/default/general</b></code>, 
<code><b>fdf/scalar/avn/general</b></code>,
<code><b>fdf/scalar/eta.gem</b></code>, etc. directories. Note, I set
up these FDFs based on the data sets I download.  Your data sets may
differ.<p>

<li>You'll notice that because of the minimal amount of data available in
the RSAS and RUC-2 Surface models, there are only a few FDFs that apply
to all models (<code><b>fdf/scalar/default/general</b></code>). Instead, most
of the FDFs are found in the model-specific directories.<p>
</ul>

Now, here are some hints for customizing the FDFs and Macros for your site:
<p>
<ol>
<li>If your FDF applies to all models, put it in the appropriate chapter in
<code><b>fdf/scalar/default</b></code>.  

<li>If your FDF does not apply to all models, copy it into the appropriate chapter
in <b>each</b> of the model-specific directories to which it does apply.

<li>When adding FDFs to model-specific chapters, modify each copy so that 
it will work with your data set.  

<li>You can mix FDFs and Macros together in the same chapter.  Macros do
not need to be stored in chapters named <code><b>macro</b></code>.

<li>You may create a new chapter in any of the model-specific directories.
However, be sure you add the chapter name to the <code><b>ScalarChapter</b></code>
variable in the Garp_defaults file.

<li>I have added several FDFs that were contributed to the SAC FTP server.
Most, but not all of these went into the <code><b>HAS</b></code>, and 
<code><b>maxT_est</b></code> chapters.   For additional information on 
some of these FDFs, check the <code><b>fdf/doc/</b></code> directory.

<li>Be sure that you understand the science behind all FDFs before you use
them.
