<P>A lat/lon grid can be displayed in any plan view plot. The user can
turn the grid on or off by default, and can independently set the lat
or lon grid spacing and labelling frequency. Convenience buttons are also
provided to set the lat/lon spacing to pre-defined values. Pressing the
Apply button in this dialog will cause GARP to redraw all its frames with
the new options set.

<P>The line color, type and width can all be changed by clicking the
Sample Line button. (Make sure the lat/lon grid toggle button is On
though.) After changing the line attributes, remember to save them
by pressing the Apply button in the Line Attributes dialog. See the
<A HREF="LineAttributes.html">Line Attributes dialog</A> for more
details.

<P>Default values for lat/lon grid spacing and line attributes can
be set in the "Garp_defaults" file.

<P>The map backgrounds dialog allows you to change what maps are drawn
for plan view plots. First, a map can only be plotted if it is toggled
On. When it is On, the map will be drawn if the scale of the existing
geographic area falls within the maxmum and minimum scales for the particular
map. The values for scale are in degrees of latitude. Having a min
and max scale allows you to customize which maps appear for different geographic
scales. For example, you could display only a low-resolution map for larger
scales, moving to a higher resolution map and additional detailed maps as the
scale shrinks.

<P>When a map is on, you may modify its line attributes by clicking 
the sample line. Color, line type and width are all configurable from the
<A HREF="LineAttributes.html">Line Attributes dialog</A>.

<P>Map defaults are set up in a table file provided with GARP. The file
location is identified by the "maplisttbl" key in the Garp_defaults file.
Each entry in the file lists the descriptive map name, the map file, whether
it is on or off, the scale values and the line attributes. Users may change
these as needed, or add additional (GEMPAK format) maps.
