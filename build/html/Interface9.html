<h2>Display Window</h2><p>
Besides displaying loaded data, several features are available through
mouse button presses and accelerator keys when the mouse is located
over the display area. These features include zooming, toggling off a 
graphic, and changing
depictable preferences such as font size, symbol size, symbol thickness,
and symbol plot density.
<p>
<h3><A NAME=Z>Zooming</A></h3>
You may zoom in on any plan view graphic by drawing a rubber
band box with the mouse (position the mouse in the upper left
corner of the desired area, press the left mouse button and
hold it, drag the mouse to the lower right corner of the area
and release the button).  Use the Area->DEFAULT to return to
the full area or Area->Previous to return to the previous area.
Note that when you zoom on an image or
surface/upper-air data graphic, GARP will go back to the data
file and extract more data (if available) to re-draw the graphic.
You can also perform a centered 2x zoom by double clicking a point in
the display window.
<p>

<h3><A NAME=G>Graphic Toggling</A></h3>
You may toggle a graphic by clicking its corresponding title. 
The display is redrawn to either include or exclude the graphic you 
toggled. Toggled off graphics have their title grayed out. 
For complex graphics it may take a while to complete the redraw.
<p>

<h3><A NAME=G>Distance Calculator</A></h3>
GARP provides a distance calculator for determining distances between
points on the display. A single left-click at any point on the display initializes
the distance calculator and displays a red cross-hair at that point. As the
user moves the mouse away from the reference point, the distance between the
reference point and the mouse position displays on the status bar. Single
clicking anywhere else on the display sets the new point as the reference point.
The distance units can be changed in the Status Bar Options menu, and the
default units can be set in the Garp_defaults file by changing the "distunits" key.
<p>
To turn the distance calculator off, hold the Control (CTRL) key down and
left-click the mouse anywhere in the display.

allow you to change the font size, symbol size, symbol thickness,
and symbol plot density.
