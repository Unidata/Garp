<p>
This dialog is accessible from the <a href="Interface2.html">main menubar</a>
under "File".
<p>
From this dialog you can save either the current frame in the display window
or all frames in a loop. You need to enter a file name to save a frame.
If you are saving more than one frame, a number starting with "1" and
indexing upward is added to the file name for each frame in the loop. After
you enter a file name in the textfield, click "Apply" to save the frame.
This GIF format file will be of the same size (in pixels) as the display
window. 
<p>
You may want to create gif files of some precise pixel resolution. You can
set the display window size from a <a href="CommandLine.html">command line 
argument</a> when you start up GARP or by setting this size in the 
<a href="Resource.html">Garp</a> resource file</a>.

<p>
Note that there is currently no print capability in GARP.
