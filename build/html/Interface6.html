<h2>Image Counter</h2><img src="gif/counter.gif"><p>
The image counter gives you feedback as to how many frames are loaded in
the current loop and which frame you are viewing. Clicking the image
counter will pop up the <a href="AnimationPref.html">animation preferences</a>
dialog. From within this dialog, you can remove bad frames and adjust animation
dwell settings and speed.
