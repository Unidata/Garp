In this dialog, you'll see a list of stations where wind profilers are located.
This list is not read from the data itself but is rather read from a static 
file. The current time of the application is used to determine the ending
time for a 24-hour time section. This time interval and end time can be 
changed by editing the textfields. Alternatively, you could also adjust the
application clock to reset this end time. Other relevant parameters such as the
lowest and highest levels as well as the data interval can also be edited.
The display is color-coded by speed with brighter colors indicating higher
speeds.
