<h2>Speed Slider</h2>
By moving the Speed slider, one can adjust the speed of an animation loop.
Moving the slider to the left slows it down and moving it to the right
speeds up the animation. One can fine tune animation speed with the
<a href="AnimationPref.html">animation preferences</a> dialog, available 
either from the "Options" dropdown menu or by clicking the image counter.
<p>
<h2>Fade Slider</h2>
The Fade slider fades out any image data to reveal other graphics that
may be difficult to see with multiple overlays.
