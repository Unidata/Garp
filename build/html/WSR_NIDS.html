<dt><h2>What is NIDS?</h2>
<dd>NIDS (Nexrad Information Dissemination System) is the mechanism
that allows delivery of a set of standard products from the WSR-88D
radars to end users. A set of 4 NIDS vendors receive the radar products and
in turn make them available to the general public.
<p>
<dt><h2>Product Descriptions</h2>
<ul>
<h2><li>BREF</h2>Base Reflectivity at the 4 lowest tilt angles. Angles
depend on radar operation mode:
<p>
<pre>
Precipitation Mode    Clear-Air Mode
------------------    --------------
0.50 degrees          0.50 degrees  
1.45                  1.50
2.40                  2.50
3.35                  3.50
</pre>
<i>(Individual sites may modify these angles for local needs.)</i>
<p>
Generated in both precipitation and clear-air modes.
<h2><li>CREF</h2>Composite Reflectivity depicting the highest reflectivity
measured vertically above each point in the display.
<p>
Generated in precip and clear-air modes.
<h2><li>LREF</h2>Layer Composite Reflectivity over 3 altitude depths.
<p>
<pre>
1.  Surface to 24,000 ft
2.  24,000  to 33,000 ft
3.  33,000  to 60,000 ft
</pre>
<p>
Generated in precip mode only.
<h2><li>VEL</h2>Radial Velocity at the 4 lowest tilt angles. Generated in precip
and clear-air modes.
<h2><li>TOPS</h2>Maximum height of in-cloud echoes. Available in precip mode
only.
<h2><li>VIL</h2>A measure of the total Vertical Integrated Liquid at all points on the image. Precip mode only.
<h2><li>PRE1</h2>1-hour precipitation accumulation.
<h2><li>PRE3</h2>3-hour precipitation accumulation.
<h2><li>PRET</h2>Storm total accumulation since the onset of precipitation.
<h2><li>Other Non-image Products</h2>These are products that we receive that cannot
be displayed as an image:
<pre>
VAD   Velocity Azimuth Display
PREA  Hourly digital rainfall array
STAT  General radar status message
