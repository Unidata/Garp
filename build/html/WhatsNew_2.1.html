What's New in Version 2.1</H1></CENTER>

<BR>&nbsp;

<P>GARP Version 2.1 is a Y2K compatible release. Previous version are not 
Y2K compliant. Compliance was verified by testing GARP with simulated data
for all data types and projections except wind profiler data and radar
data. Other new capablilites are listed below.

 Time templates using a 4 digit year (in Garp_defaults) are fully functional.
 Caveat: if the time stamp in a file name template defines the year in 4
digits, then on January 1st, dattims will be listed in correct order on
the data type scrolled lists. If not, then dattims in 1999 will appear
below times in 2000. This is because the files beginning with "00" are
listed before files beginning with "99" when a directory list is compiled.
This problem can be fixed by changing the file template to define the year
in YYYY format and renaming the files to reflect this change.

 There was a directory dependency for FDFs that was removed.
Previously, the model specific directory was built from the default
FDF directory using "../.." . The problem with this method is that the
default directory would have to exist in order to step using a relative
path (../..). This dependency was removed so the default directory path
and the model specific directory path are fully defined as absolute
paths. This change also affected FDF directory definitions in
Garp_defaults. The "default" directory is no longer defined as part of
the FDF directory keys (such as scalarfdf, vectorfdf, etc).

  Fixed a bug that occurred when the user changed models and ran the same
macro for plan view model data. Previously, the macro path was incorrect
so the macro would fail to display anything.

A few memory leaks plugged.</LI>
