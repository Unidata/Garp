<h2>Overlay Station Locations</h2>

<p>
Sometimes it's useful to overlay static data on top of a graphical display
for navigation reference. From this dialog, you can overlay the position of
locations defined in a GEMPAK station format file on the GARP display 
window. The positions of the stations will be indicated by a marker which
you can choose from this dialog.
<p>
Besides the positions, you can also display other data in the station 
tables such as station ID, numeric code, name, and elevation. With toggle
buttons at the bottom of this dialog, you can control whether you want 
either the marker or the station identifier or both to be displayed.
<p>
Since this data is static, it is automatically loaded into each frame of a
loop you have already loaded. If you only want to display this information
on a map, choose the map you want from the <a href="Areas.html">Areas</a>
dropdown menu and then go to this dialog.

<h2>Overlay Radar Range Rings</h2>

<p>
From this dialog you can overlay concentric circles corresponding to 
radar range rings. You can specify the number of range rings to draw,
the distance units to use, the minimum distance to draw the first
ring, and the increment to draw them thereafter. The default behavior 
is to draw range rings around all radar sites.
You can change this behavior to draw a single range ring by pressing
the "Single Station" radio button.  The range ring will be drawn
for the station ID specified in the lower right corner of the dialog
box.
