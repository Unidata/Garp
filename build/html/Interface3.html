Data Types</H2>
<IMG SRC="gif/datatypes.gif" NOSAVE HEIGHT=49 WIDTH=468>

<P>&nbsp;There are 10 icons beneath the Menubar. Each icon represents a
different data type or graphic type, except the last two which allow clearing
and reset. GARP allows you to freely combine data of different types (i.e.,
satellite and model data, or radar and obs data, etc.) within the constraints
of GEMPAK. Notice that as you pass the mouse over the icons, a window appears
telling you what the data or graphic type is. When loading multiple frames
into a loop, you may interrupt the loading by clicking the Clear or Reset
icons.
<H3>
<A HREF="RadSatData.html"><IMG SRC="gif/icon03.gif" NOSAVE HEIGHT=32 WIDTH=32></A><A HREF="RadSatData.html">
Radar and Satellite Data</A></H3>
The default number of satellite images to load is hard coded into GARP.
You can change the images to select by clicking the file name with your
mouse. To select a single image, click once. To select multiple images
in sequence, click and hold the mouse button as you slide up or down the
list. To select multiple images out of sequence, press the CTRL key and
click each image to load. If you have already loaded some other data and
time matching is turned on, the list will be highlighted and desensitized
to indicate these are the images which time match the previously loaded
data.
<H3>
<A HREF="SurfaceData.html"><IMG SRC="gif/icon07.gif" NOSAVE HEIGHT=32 WIDTH=32></A><A HREF="SurfaceData.html">
Surface Observational Data</A></H3>
This icon refers to surface data plotted in a standard surface chart. Surface
METARs, mesonet, and ship/buoy data are now supported along with any other
data written in GEMPAK format files. The standard METARs are available
from "synoptic", mesonet from "mesonet", and ship and buoy from "ship/buoy".
You can select/deselect which data is plotted by clicking the Station Layout
button. The default uses one color for all data; the multi-color button
activates multiple colors. All the available dates/times from the data
files are listed in the scroll window. Select the date/times with the mouse.
<H3>
<A HREF="ProfilerData.html"><IMG SRC="gif/icon09.gif" NOSAVE HEIGHT=32 WIDTH=32></A><A HREF="ProfilerData.html">
Profiler Data</A></H3>
Profiler data from individual sites can be plotted as a time series over
some time interval, usually 24 hours.
<H3>
<A HREF="SoundingData.html"><IMG SRC="gif/icon08.gif" NOSAVE HEIGHT=32 WIDTH=32></A><A HREF="SoundingData.html">
Upper-Air Data</A></H3>
This icon will give you upper-air observational data plotted in a standard
plan view upper-air chart or a thermodynamic diagram. The Type option button
at the top of this dialog allows you to discriminate between plan view and
vertical projections. In plan
view, you can select/deselect what data is plotted by clicking
the Station Layout button. You can change the level by clicking the Pressure
Level button. All the available dates/times from the data files are listed
in the scroll window. Select the date/times with the mouse.
The vertical projection allows you to display either a Stuve or Skew-T Log-P
thermodynamic diagram.
<H3>
<A HREF="MPVData.html"><IMG SRC="gif/icon12.gif" NOSAVE HEIGHT=32 WIDTH=32></A><A HREF="MPVData.html">
Plan View Gridded Data</A></H3>
Clicking this icon will give you plan view gridded data plotted with contours,
vectors (barbs or arrows), streamlines, or grid point values. GARP can
display gridded data from a number of models; this is defined in the $GARPHOME/config/Garp_defaults
file. Data can be displayed in any coordinate system that is defined in
a grid file.

<P>The level can be chosen by either pressing the Level button or by typing
in the level (or levels in the case of a layer quantity).

<P>The date/times/forecast hours listed in the scroll window are extracted
from each data file. As a result, you may notice an extra second or three
processing time.

<P>To get specific information about the available times, levels, and fields
in a given grid file, press the Info button. This window will allow you
to open a grid file and get a GDINFO summary of the available grids in
the file.

<P>The "Scalar:" and "Vector:" buttons allow grouping of FDFs from which
to choose. The scrolling windows contain some pre-defined functions for
plotting gridded data. You may select any of these functions and the GEMPAK
GFUNC or GVECT specification will appear in the input window below the
scroll windows. These functions are defined in FDFs (Field Description
Files), which are text files stored in the $GARPHOME/fdf/ directory tree.
Please see the section <A HREF="FDF.html">FDF Description</A> for more
information about creating your own FDFs and <A HREF="Macros.html">Macros
Description</A> for information about macros.

<P>In addition to the pre-defined functions, you may type in ANY valid
GEMPAK GFUNC or GVECT in the input window. Inline parameters (^ @ %) are
accepted. From within any GEMPAK program you can type "phelp gfunc" 
on the command line for more information. Note that if you
are manually inputting a GFUNC or GVECT specification, you must select
Scalar or Vector, as appropriate.

<P>For more user control over the way your contour/vector plot looks, click
the More button. This will allow you to specify contour lines or color
fill, what type of line or list of colors to use, how often to label the
contour lines, the contour interval, minimum, and maximum, whether High/Low
symbols are plotted, and, for vectors, whether wind barbs or arrows are
used. Please note that the Field Description box may give valuable information
on how a specific pre-defined function is used.

<P>Finally, in order to plot a gridded data graphic, you must be sure to
select the date/time(s), the level, and a scalar or vector function. If
you forget any of these, your graphic will not plot. Some FDFs include
the definition for the level. In these cases, any value in the Level box
is overwritten. Press the Display or the Display and Close button to draw
the graphics. The Clear icon will interrupt the drawing.
<H3>
<A HREF="MXSData.html"><IMG SRC="gif/icon14.gif" NOSAVE HEIGHT=32 WIDTH=32></A><A HREF="MXSData.html">
Cross-Sectional Gridded Data</A></H3>
Much of the cross-section dialog is the same as the plan view model grid
display. The main difference is that you must specify cross section
end points in the form STN1>STN2 or LAT;LON1>LAT;LON2. Also, you can choose
to display a graphic between two levels by setting level1 (lower level)
and/or level2 (upper level). Data is then displayed between these two levels.
<H3>
<A HREF="MTHData.html"><IMG SRC="gif/icon19.gif" NOSAVE HEIGHT=32 WIDTH=32></A><A HREF="MTHData.html">
Time Height Gridded Data</A></H3>
The model time height window looks much like the Cross Section dialog box.
You can only choose one model run per loop.
<H3>
<A HREF="MVPData.html"><IMG SRC="gif/icon21.gif" NOSAVE HEIGHT=32 WIDTH=32></A><A HREF="MVPData.html">
Vertical Profile Gridded Data</A></H3>
The model vertical profile looks similar to the upper-air vertical profile
dialog box. Please note, when drawing a skew-T diagram (the default), you
may not change the functions plotted. The temperature and dewpoint data
will automatically be drawn.
<H3>
<IMG SRC="gif/iconclr.gif" NOSAVE HEIGHT=32 WIDTH=32> Clear</H3>
This icon will clear the drawing window of all frames. You may also use
the Clear icon to interrupt the loading of any loop. Note, the Clear button
will NOT reset the graphics area (GAREA), so if you have zoomed or changed
the default area, your graphic will stay that way. After all the data frames
are cleared, the background maps are redrawn. This provides a geographic
context for subsequent data plotting.
<H3>
<IMG SRC="gif/icon26.gif" NOSAVE HEIGHT=32 WIDTH=32> Reset</H3>
This icon will clear the drawing window of all frames and will also reset
the GAREA to the DEFAULT value. You may also use the Reset icon to interrupt
the loading of any loop.

Refreshing Data Lists and the Grid Cache</H2>
GARP goes out to disk and reads the available data whenever a data display
dialog is accessed. The one exception is gridded data, where a cache is
used to speed up access to the data. The grid cache is updated only if
the list of files for each model type changes. In other words, the cache
is updated only if a new grid file is created or one is removed. It does
not update if new grids are added to an existing grid file.&nbsp; Because
of this, each data display dialog contains a Refresh button that forces
GARP to go out and read the data off of disk to refresh the list. In the
case of gridded data, the cache is emptied for the current model, and the
available data is re-read from disk. So the Refresh button provided a mechanism
to ensure that the list of data is current.
