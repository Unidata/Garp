This status bar is located at the bottom of the GARP main window.
The data that appears in the status bar is configurable in the
<a href="StatusBar.html">Status Bar Preferences</a> menu so it may
not look quite like the image above. Typically though, there is a
date time on the left side and information relevant to content in
the display window is given to the right. For example, when you move
the cursor around in the display area the pixel position is updated
under <b>XY:</b>. If you have images loaded, the raw pixel value will
display, and possibly additional values as well. For example, an IR image
will have the brightness temperature displayed, and a radar reflectivity
product will have the dbz value displayed.
If you have marked an anchor point for a postion (with a left mouse
button click), you will also see
the distance from this anchor position. Units for this distance are
configurable in the <a href="StatusBar.html">Status Bar Preferences</a>
dialog.
