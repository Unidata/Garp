This clock indicates the current time registered within the GARP application.
In some instances, particularly for case studies, it is convenient to 
change the date and time and run in a displaced real-time mode. Date and 
time are broken down into component buttons in this dialog. To change
a time component, click the corresponding button and then the left arrow button
to decrease its value or the right arrow button to increase it.
<p>
To apply your change click Apply at the bottom of the dialog. To reset
the time to real time click Reset. To quit without changes, click
Close. The date and time are written to the <a href="Interface7.html">status
bar</a> at the bottom of the main window.
