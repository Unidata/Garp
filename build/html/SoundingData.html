<p>
Sounding data can be displayed in either a plan view or profile projection.
When displaying it in plan view, you will need only to choose the date/time
stamps and vertical level you want to display. By default, time filtering
is on to limit date/times to 00Z and 12Z times. You can toggle this off
to see intermediate times but these will likely be very sparse. You can
click the Station Layout to determine which station parameters you want 
toggled
on. Levels in the Pressure Level button are configurable in "Garp_defaults".
<h2>Vertical Projection</h2>

<p>
From this dialog you can display a vertical profile of a sounding at a 
given upper-air station. The available date/times are dynamically generated
by reading your data files whereas the station list at the bottom of this 
dialog is read from a static file. You could edit this static file in
$GARPHOME/tables and put your favorite stations near the top of the list
to make them more easily accessible. You can display more than one station
and date/time within a display loop, if desired. To the left of the date/time
scrolled list are controls for display type, time filtering and line type.
If you overlay vertical profiles in consecutive calls from this dialog,
the overlay color will be indexed.
