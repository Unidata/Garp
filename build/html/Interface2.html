<p>
 The main menubar gives you access to all the features in GARP. Other buttons
under this menubar give you quicker access to a subset of the features
available in the application. Starting from the left side of the menubar,
we'll step through each dropdown menu and discuss the capabilities each button
provides.
<p>
<img src="gif/file.gif"><p>
<ul>
<li>"<a href="SaveGif.html">Save</a>" allows you to save the current 
graphics as GIF files. You can
save either a single frame in a loop or the entire loop.
<li>"Quit" allows you to quit GARP.
</ul>
<img src="gif/view.gif"><p>
"View" contains menu items for selecting particular data types. This
provides an alternate means of performing actions if the 
<a href="Interface3.html">data type icons</a> have been turned off.

<p>
<img src="gif/area.gif"><p>
From the buttons available under the "Area" dropdown menu, you can choose
a predefined <a href="Areas.html">geographic region</a> which will be drawn
in plan view displays.
<p>

<img src="gif/time.gif"><p>
With the "Time" dropdown menu you can adjust time-related parameters.
<ul>
<li>"Auto-Update" allows you to toggle auto-update on/off and set the
number of minutes between auto-update cycles. See the <a href="AutoUpdate.html">
Auto-Update</a> page for more information on this feature.
<li>"Time Matching" allows you to apply one of a number of time matching 
schemes. See the <a href="TimeMatch.html">Time Matching</a> page for
more detail on that.
<li>"Set Time" allows you to adjust the current time in GARP. This is 
particularly useful when running in case study mode where the time 
in the application is not real time. You can reset the time either from one
of the predefined time increments or by adjusting the 
<a href="Clock.html">clock</a>.
</ul>
<p>

<a href="Options.html"><img src="gif/options.gif">Options</a> are too numerous
to list on this page and deserve their own page.<p>

<a href="Help.html"><img src="gif/help.gif">Hypertext help</a>
is available from this button.
