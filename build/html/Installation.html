 Installing GARP is pretty well documented in the installation notes below.
You will need a computer running some brand of Unix on a 
<a href="SupportedPlatforms.html">supported platform</a> to run GARP.
You will also need some means of acquiring the data you want to view in one
of the <a href="SupportedDataTypes.html">supported data types</a>. Unless
you are installing a standalone version of GARP complete with configuration
tables, you will also need to install
<a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/gempak/index.html">N-AWIPS </a> 
first. That given, follow the instructions below.
<p>

This is the sixth general release of GARP, version 2.1.
