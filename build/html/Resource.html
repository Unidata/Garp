<p>
When GARP starts up, it reads in two resource files called "Garp" and "Garp2".
These resource files define resources for widgets in the Graphical User
Interface (GUI). We recommend that you do not change them. However, if you
are experienced with resource files, you can edit them to customize
the GUI. This may be particularly useful if your screen resolution
is such that the interface does not display well. In this case, you can
experiment with the sizes of different widgets to improve the appearance.
You might want to try changing the dimensions of scrolled lists
first since these will have a significant influence upon the size of the
dialogs that contain them.
<p>
The "Garp" and "Garp2" resource files contain comments that will help 
indicate which dialog 
a given widget is located in. These files should be located in a directory
pointed to by the environment variable XUSERFILESEARCHPATH.
