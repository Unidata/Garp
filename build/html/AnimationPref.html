<P>This dialog combines animation tools with frame editing tools. After
you've loaded a loop of data, there will be a button for each frame loaded
under the Frame counter at the top of this dialog. Clicking on a
particular numbered button causes GARP to display that frame. If, for example,
you have a corrupted frame in the loop, you can click the frame number
that is corrupted and then click the Remove button under Edit. You can
remove any number of frames using this sequence of keystrokes. You can
add a frame back into your animation loop by selecting the frame button
to add back in and then pressing the Undo button.

<P>The remaining widgets below these frame editing components are for fine
tuning animation speed and dwell settings. The Pause Settings allow you
to set the dwell after the first frame, between intermediate frames and
after the last frame. Animation Speed buttons have predefined dwell settings
to allow you to quickly adjust the animation to a fast or slow speed. The
<A HREF="Interface5.html">animation controls</A> at the bottom of this
dialog are identical to those on the main window.
