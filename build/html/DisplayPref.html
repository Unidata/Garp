This dialog allows you to set several preferences for the entire display
window.
<p>
<br>
<h3>Plot fills window area</h3>
<p>This option allows you to control the extent of the area used in the
drawing window. By default, GARP will try to use as much space in the 
window as it can for drawing. However, if this option is unset, GARP will 
use the exact specified geographic area. For example, if the user zooms
(using the zoom box) over some area, the resulting area will be exactly 
the area in the zoom box.
<p>
<br>

<h3>Reset when loading images</h3>
By default, GARP performs a "reset" whenever the user loads an image. This 
means all the georeferencing information is released and the full image is 
displayed. The user can override this behavior by unsetting this option. 
No reset will occur and the image being loaded will display in the current 
geographic area (even if no part of the image covers the current area!).
<p>
<br>

<h3>Display partial frames</h3>
<p>
When plotting data, GARP normally updates the window after all the 
component data objects are finished drawing. That way, the user sees the 
entire frame plot at once. But, with this option set, data objects are displayed
as they are plotted.
