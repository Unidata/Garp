<p>
If "time matching" is enabled, GARP will automatically match times
between data sets.  Thus, if you are constructing an overlay
from two different data types, GARP will preselect the list of
times for the second data type that match the times selected for
the first data type.  Once time matching has been enabled, the
user may not easily override the preselected times.  To do so,
the user must turn off time matching.
<p>
 One can configure in "Garp_defaults whether time matching is on by
default or off . To adjust time matching at runtime, click Time
and then Time Matching from the main menubar. Strict time matching
means data must reside within a predefined time interval for a time match
to be found. This interval is defined for each data type in "Garp_defaults".
To remove this requirement of a time interval and just use
the closest time match, choose Closest. To turn off time matching
altogether, choose None. For model data, you have the alternative of
using either a forecast run or analysis times to time match against.
<p>
 You can click the Refresh button at the bottom of any data dialog to
reload the contents of the date/time scrolled list. This is convenient
when a model is just arriving or if you turn off time matching and want to
see all the available data.
