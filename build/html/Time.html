GARP contains some sophisticated time functionality to enhance real-time
and case study viewing. For real-time data, GARP incorporates several
<a href="TimeMatch.html">time matching</a> schemes as well as the ability 
to toggle off time matching. <a href="AutoUpdate.html">Auto-update</a> 
is another feature useful for viewing real-time data. It allows you to 
define an interval over which the data you have loaded will be updated.
<p>
For viewing case study data, you can <a href="Clock.html">set the clock</a>
in GARP to some previous
time. While in this mode, you can still utilize both time matching and 
auto-update if you desire.
