<p>
This dialog allows you to modify the color table used for images. Each image
type has (or should have) a default color table defined in the GEMPAK
file $GEMTBL/sat/imgtyp.tbl . To choose a different color table, click one 
of the enhancements in this list. The first entry in the scrolled list will 
reset the color table to that default setting if you have modified it.
Experience will dictate which color tables work best with which types of 
imagery.
<p>
Once you have chosen a color table, you can use the Fade slider to adjust
the saturation of the image or roll the color table with the Roll slider.
In this context, rolling means that color indices are displaced linearly so
you can set a particular part of the color table to match a particular
pixel brightness.
<p>
Similar to the Roll slider is the Invert button with which you can 
invert the color table, swapping high pixel values with lower ones.
<p>
At the top of the enhancement dialog is a Retain button that allows you
to keep using a color table regardless of what imagery is loaded. Normally,
the default color table is used when an image is first loaded.
<p>
Only one color table may be loaded at a time.  This applies to
all sessions of GARP, and originates in the N-AWIPS color allocation
algorithm inherited by GARP.
