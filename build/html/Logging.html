<p>
The Logging Preferences dialog allows you to configure whether logging 
information is written, where it is written, and how much is written.
GARP has several verbose levels. At level "0", GARP will only write out
error statements. At level "1", you will also see function names. At 
level "2" you will see level 1 information as well as information about 
variables within a function. At
level "3", all printable statements are printed to output, including any
table files which are read in. These verbose levels are very useful for 
debugging.
<p>
The output may be written to a standard error (typically a text window),
a logging window, or a file. If you start GARP from NTL, standard error is
probably set to /dev/null so you will only see output if you write it to
the GARP logging window or a file. The logging window is accessible by 
clicking the "Display Log" button at the bottom of this dialog.
<p>
For fatal errors that crash GARP before the GUI is accessible, you can 
start it up in verbose mode using a <a href="CommandLine.html">
command line argument</a>. In this case you would type at the Unix prompt:
<pre>
garp -verbose 3
</pre>
to start up GARP in its highest verbose level.
