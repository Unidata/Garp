Once the GARP distribution has been physically installed on your system, it
must be configured to work properly. This configuration
process involves setting some environment variables and editing the
file "Garp_defaults" to reflect the type of data you have available and
where that data resides in your file system. Although it is not recommended,
you may also want to edit your GARP resource files to further customize
the GUI. Finally, when you start GARP, you can further customize
some aspects of the interface through command line arguments.
